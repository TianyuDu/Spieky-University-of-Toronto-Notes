### Chapter 8 Probability

#### 8.1 Sample Spaces, Event and Probability

A **Experiment** is a process that creates *two or more* outcomes.

A **Random Experiment** is an experiment such that the outcomes *cannot* be determined with certainty.

A **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes in a random experiment.

Let $S$ be the sample space, $E$ be an event, define 

$P(E)$ := probability of $E$.

**Assumption: ** assume that each outcome in $S$ has equal likelihood to be chosen into $E$.



Example 1: Toss a coin once.

$S = \{H,T\}$
