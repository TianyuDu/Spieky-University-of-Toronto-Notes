### 9.6 Normal Distribution

Let $X$ be a <u>continuous</u> random variable with range $(-\infty, \infty)$ 

With $\mu$ as mean and $\sigma^2$ as variance.

If the histogram is symmetric at $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ measures the separation of data.

We say $X$ follows a <u>normal distribution</u> with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, denoted as 

$X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$



**Definition** A <u>standard normal distribution</u> is a normal distribution with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$
