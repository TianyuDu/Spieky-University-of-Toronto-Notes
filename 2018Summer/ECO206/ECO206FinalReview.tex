    \section{Lecture 1 Budget Constraints}
    
        \subsection{Notation-Bundle}
            \begin{definition}
                If we have $n$ goods, then vector $(x_1^A, x_2^A, \dots, x_n^A) \in \R^n_+$ represents a \textbf{bundle}, where $x_1^A$ represents a quantity($x$) of good 1 in bundle A. 
            \end{definition}
            
        \subsection{Types of Income}
            \paragraph{Exogenous}independent to price of goods.
            \paragraph{Endogenous}bundle of goods endowed, value dependents on price of goods.
            
        \subsection{Budget Set}
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Budget Set} is the set of all affordable consumption \emph{bundles}. Let $\vec{e}=(\omega_1,\omega_2,\dots,\omega_n) \in \R^n_+$ denote the endowment of consumer and $I$ denote the exogenous income, and consumers are price-takers facing price vector $\vec{p}$. Then
                \[
                    \mathcal{B} = \big\{\vec{x}\in \R^n_+ \vert \vec{x}\cdot\vec{p} \leq \vec{e}\cdot\vec{p} + I  \big\}
                \]
            \end{definition}
            
        \subsection{Opportunity Cost}
            \par Opportunity cost is the rate at which one good can be traded for another though the \emph{market}. It captures what the consumer is \textbf{able} to trade at market price, not what the consumer is \emph{willing} to trade.
            \par Consider budget constraint $\vec{x}\cdot\vec{p}=I$. Take the total differential,
            \[
                \sum_i \pd{\vec{x}\cdot\vec{p}}{x_i} d{x_i} = 0
            \]
            And the opportunity cost for one unit of good $x$ is shown to be 
            \[
                \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{p_x}{p_y}
            \]
            
        \subsection{Income and Price changes}
        \par \ul{Pure Income Changes: } \emph{parallel shift} of budget line.
        \par \ul{Price changes: } \emph{rotation} of budget line around the \emph{invariant point} (i.e. the consumption bundle that is not affected by the price change).
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Exogenous income: Invariant point $\impliedby$ $\{x_1, \dots, x_i=0, \dots, x_n\}$ with $p_i$ changes. 
                \item Endogenous income: Invariant point $\impliedby$ endowment point $\vec{e}$.
            \end{enumerate}
            
    \section{Lecture 2 Preferences and Utility}
        \subsection{Tastes as Binary Relations}
            \begin{definition}
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Bundle A $(x_1^A, x_2^A)$ is \textbf{strictly preferred to} bundle B $(x_1^B, x_2^B)$.
                        \[
                            (x_1^A, x_2^A) \succ (x_1^B, x_2^B)
                        \]
                    \item Bundle A is \textbf{at least as good as} bundle B
                        \[
                            (x_1^A, x_2^A) \succcurlyeq (x_1^B, x_2^B)
                        \]
                    \item The consumer is indifferent between bundle A and bundle B
                        \[
                            (x_1^A, x_2^A) \sim (x_1^B, x_2^B)
                        \]
                \end{enumerate}
            \end{definition}
        
        \subsection{Rationality Assumptions}
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Complete: } For all bundles $A=(x_1^A, x_2^A)$ and $B=(x_1^B, x_2^B)$.
                \[
                    A \succcurlyeq B \lor B \succcurlyeq A
                \]
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Transitive: } for any three bundles, $A, B, C$
                \[
                    A \succcurlyeq B \land B \succcurlyeq C \implies A \succcurlyeq C
                \]
            \end{definition}
        
        \subsection{Convenience Assumptions}
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Monotonic: }
                \[
                    A \succcurlyeq B\ \impliedby \ x_i^A \geq x_i^B \ \forall \ i
                \]
                \[
                    A \succ B\ \impliedby \ x_i^A > x_i^B \ \forall \ i
                \]
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Convexity: } Suppose $A = (x_1^A, x_2^A) \sim B = (x_1^B, x_2^B)$
                \[
                    \alpha A + (1 - \alpha) B \succcurlyeq A,\ \forall \ \alpha \in [0, 1]
                \]
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Continuity: } (no sudden jumps)
            \end{definition}
        
        \subsection{Utility Function and Indifference Curve}
            \begin{definition}
                Let $\mathcal{X}$ denote the consumption set and a \textbf{utility function} is a real-valued function $u:\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \R_+$ so that
                \[
                    A \succcurlyeq B \iff u(A) \geq u(B)
                \]
                and
                \[
                    A \succ B \iff u(A) > u(B)
                \]
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{remark}
                The \ul{positive monotone transformations} of utility function of a preference also captures the same preference. 
            \end{remark}
            
            \begin{definition}
                The \textbf{indifference curve} corresponding to utility level $\overline{u}$ is a set of consumption bundles
                \[
                    \{\vec{x} \in \R^n_+\ \vert\ u(\vec{x}) = \overline{u} \}
                \]
            \end{definition}
            
        \subsection{Marginal Rate of Substitution}
            \begin{definition}
                The \textbf{MRS} is the number of good $y$ that a consumer is \textbf{willing} to given up in order to get one more unit of good $x$.
                \\Take total differential of equation $u(\vec{x}) = \overline{u}$,
                \[
                    \sum_{i}{
                        \pd{u(\vec{x})}{x_i} d{x_i} = 0
                        }
                    \implies
                    \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}
                \]
                And MRS is a function of bundle $\vec{x}$.
            \end{definition}
            
            \paragraph{Diminishing MRS} is when the \textbf{absolute MRS} decreases as more good $x$ is consumed along the indifference curve.
            
        \subsection{Different Types of Tastes}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Perfect Substitutes} MRS constant at every bundle.
                \item \textbf{Perfect Complements} Unwilling to substitute.
                \item \textbf{Homothetic} MRS constant on a ray ($\beta \vec{x_o},\ \beta > 0$) through origin.
                \item \textbf{Quasi-linear} MRS depends on $\vec{x_{-i}}$ where $x_i$ is excluded.
            \end{itemize}
            
    \section{Lecture 3 Choice}
        \paragraph{Diminishing MRS in words} Comparing two bundles on the \emph{same} indifferent curve. At each bundle consider how much of $y$ we are willing to given up for an additional unit of $x$. \emph{If we have relatively \ul{more} $x$ in one bundle, then we are \ul{less} willing to give up $y$ at that bundle compared to the other bundle}.
        
        \begin{remark}
            Perfect Substitutes (linear in every commodity) $\implies$ quasi-linear.
        \end{remark}
        
        \subsection{Lagrangian Multiplier}
            \paragraph{Sufficiency} FOCs from Lagrangian multiplier is both necessary and sufficient if and only if
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item There are no "flat spots" on indifference curves.
                    \item All goods are essential (\ul{interior solution})
                    \item Both choice set (characterized by budget constraint) and tastes (characterized by preference and utility function, quasi-concave).
                \end{enumerate}
            \paragraph{Uniqueness} Assuming \textbf{convexity} of preferences and choice set guarantees \emph{uniqueness} of optimal choice. (Reducing problem to a convex optimization problem).
        
        \subsection{Problem Solving}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Determine preference type.
                \item Check expectation of interior solution.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item If interior solution (e.g. Cobb-Douglas): setup and solve Lagrangian multiplier, check sufficiency.
                    \item If not:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Perfect Substitute: Corner Solution if $MRS \neq rel.Price$.
                        \item Perfect Complement: Solution on path $x_1=\gamma x_2$.
                        \item Quasi-linear: interior solutions found for some parameter values only. \emph{Use LM to find expression of solution and check the condition for positiveness}.
                    \end{enumerate}
                \end{itemize}
                \item Check for \emph{multiple optimal solutions}.
            \end{enumerate}
            
    \section{Lectuer 4 Demand and Income Effects}
        \subsection{Demand}
            \begin{definition}
                A \textbf{demand function} is an equation that expresses \ul{bundle choices} as a \ul{function} of prices and incomes.
            \end{definition}
            
        \subsection{Income Effects}
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Income effect} is the change in behavior arising from just a change in income and leads to a parallel shift in the budget constraint.
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{remark}
                With quasi-linear preference with numeraire $x_1$, then the demand for all \ul{other} commodities other than $x_1$ have no income effect. We often refer to quasi-linear goods as the borderline goods between normal and inferior.
            \end{remark}
            
            \begin{remark}
                With pure income effect and homothetic preference, the ratios of commodities before and after are the same.
            \end{remark}
            
            \begin{definition}
                A \textbf{Engel curve} $x_i^D(I, \vec{p})$ captures the relationship between \ul{demand} and \ul{income}. Note: put $I$ on y-axis.
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Normal goods} $\pd{x}{I} > 0$
                \item \textbf{Inferior goods} $\pd{x}{I} < 0$
            \end{itemize}
            
        \subsection{Decomposition of Substitution Effect and Income Effect}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Substitution Effect} changing \ul{relative prices} holding the \ul{utility level constant}.
                \item \textbf{Income Effect} changing \ul{purchasing power} of the consumer's income holding 
                \ul{relative prices constant}.
            \end{itemize}
            
    \section{Lecture 5 Income and Substitution Effects}
        \begin{definition}
            \textbf{Hicksian substitution effect} derived by compensating consumer enough income so that the consumer can reach the \ul{original utility level} after the price changes.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            \textbf{Slutsky substitution effect} derived by compensating consumer enough income so that the consumer can afford the \ul{original optimal bundle} after the price changes.
        \end{definition}
        
        \subsection{Expenditure Minimization}
            \begin{definition}
                With \ul{new prices}, given consumer enough (hypothetical) income to just reach the \ul{original indifference curve}. Mathematically,
                \[
                    min_{x_1,x_2} p_1^{final} x_1 + p_2^{final} x_2 \ s.t.\ u(x_1, x_2) = U^{initial} = u(x_1^{initial}, x_2^{initial})
                \]
            \end{definition}
            
            \par Solving the expenditure using Lagrangian multiplier method 
                \[
                    \mc{L}(\vec{x}, \lambda) = \vec{x} \cdot \vec{p} + \lambda\{\overline{u} - u(\vec{x}) \}
                \]
                Let $\vec{x}^{SE} = (x_1^{SE}, x_2^{SE}, \dots, x_N^{SE}) = argmin_{\vec{x}}\{\vec{p} \cdot \vec{x}\ s.t.\ u(\vec{x}) = \overline{u}\}$ and $\vec{p}^{new} \cdot \vec{x}$ denote the \textbf{compensated income}.
            
            \begin{definition}
                From expenditure minimization, we define the \textbf{expenditure function} $e(\vec{p}, 
                \overline{u}): \R^{n+1}_+ \rightarrow \R_+$ as a function of price vector $\vec{p}$ and utility level $\overline{u}$.
                \[
                    e(\vec{p}, \overline{u}) := min_{\vec{x}} \{\vec{p} \cdot \vec{x} \ s.t. \ u(\vec{x}) = \overline{u} \}
                \]
            \end{definition}
            
        \subsection{Income Effect}
            \begin{remark} Decomposing substitution and income effects.
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item The utility value achieved is $\overline{u} = u(\vec{x}^*_1)$.
                    \item Given prices $\vec{p}_1, \vec{p}_2$, use \ul{utility maximization} to find optimal bundles $\vec{x}^*_1, \vec{x}^*_2$.
                    \item Use \ul{expenditure minimization} with respect to \ul{new price} and \ul{original utility level} to find $\vec{x}_{SE}(\vec{p}_2, \overline{u})$.
                    \item Substitution effect is $\vec{x}_{SE} - \vec{x}^*_1$.
                    \item Income effect is $\vec{x}^*_2 - \vec{x}_{SE}$.
                \end{enumerate}

            \begin{remark}

            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Compensated demand (Hicksian)} captures the changes in $x_1$ as $p_1$ changes, when \ul{utility level is held fixed}(hitting the same IC) by compensating consumer additional income. (On graph: initial to SE)

        \begin{theorem}
            \[
                \pd{x_i}{p_j} = \pd{h_i}{p_j} - h_j \pd{x_i}{y}
            \]
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            Notice that at the optimal, $x_i(\vec{p}, e(\vec{p}, u)) = h_i(\vec{p}, u)$, take derivative with respect to $p_j$ we have
            \[
                \pd{x_i}{p_j} + \pd{x_i}{e} \pd{e}{p_j} = \pd{h_i}{p_j}
            \]
            By Sheppard's Lemma $\pd{e(\vec{p}, u)}{p_j} = h_j(\cdot)$, 
            \[
                \pd{x_i}{p_j} = \pd{h_i}{p_j} - h_j \pd{x_i}{y}
            \]

                \max_{c, \ell} u(c,\ell)\\ s.t.\ c \leq w(L - \ell) + M
            \end{gather*}
            Let $c^*(w), \ell^*(w)$ denote the maximizers and \textbf{labor supply} is
            \[
                h(w) = L - \ell(w)
            \]
            \begin{example}
                For wage rate $w$ increases:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Substitution effect: $\ell \downarrow$ and $h \uparrow$
                    \item Income effect (positive):

                            \item (Inferior leisure) $\ell \downarrow$ and $h \uparrow$

            \begin{remark}
                Labor supply is \ul{upwards sloping} if \ul{substitution effect dominates income effect} or leisure is considered as \ul{inferior}.

        \subsection{Taxes and Labor Supply}
            \begin{remark}
                \emph{Proportional income tax} is effective a change in real wage $w$ faced by consumers. Consider both \ul{income effect} (and notice leisure could be inferior or normal) and \ul{substitution effect}. 
            \end{remark}
            
            \subsubsection{Laffer Curve (Optional)}
                \begin{definition}
                    \textbf{Laffer curve} captures the relation between \ul{tax revenue} and \ul{marginal tax rate}. For proportional income tax, tax revenue $T(\tau)$ is
                    \[
                        T(\tau) = \tau*w*h(\tau)
                    \]
                    and marginal tax revenue depends on the \ul{elasticity of labor supply}.
                \end{definition}
                
        \subsection{Elasticity}
            \begin{definition}
                The \textbf{own price elasticity of demand} for commodity $i$ at coordinate $(x_i, p_i)$ on its demand curve is 
                \[
                    \epsilon_i = \frac{
                        \frac{dx_i}{x_i}
                        }{
                        \frac{dp_i}{p_i}
                        }
                    = \frac{dx_i}{dp_i} \frac{p_i}{x_i}
                \]
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Cross price elasticity of demand} for commodity $i$ with respect to price of commodity $j$ is 
                \[
                    \epsilon_{i,j} = \frac{dx_i}{dp_j}\frac{p_j}{x_i}
                \]
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{definition}
                The \textbf{income elasticity of demand} for commodity $i$ is
                \[
                    \eta_{i} = \frac{dx_i}{dI}\frac{I}{x_i}
                \]
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{definition} Elasticity $\epsilon$ is classified as 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{Elastic} if $|\epsilon| > 1$.
                    \item \textbf{Inelastic} if $|\epsilon| < 1$.
                    \item \textbf{Unit elastic} if $|\epsilon| = 1$.
                    \item \textbf{Perfectly inelastic} if $|\epsilon| = 0$.
                    \item \textbf{Perfectly elastic} if $|\epsilon| = \infty$.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{definition}
            
        \subsection{Change in Revenue}
            \par Total revenue $TR(p) = p*x(p)$, take derivative with respect to $p$ on both sides
            \begin{gather*}
                \pd{TR(p)}{p} = x(p) + p\pd{x(p)}{p} \\
                \implies \pd{TR(p)}{p} = x(p) \{ 1 + \pd{x(p)}{p} \frac{p}{x(p)} \} = x(p) \{1 - |\epsilon| \}\\
                \implies \pd{TR(p)}{p} > 0 \iff |\epsilon| < 1 \\

    \section{Lecture 7 Elasticity and Consumer Surplus}
        \subsection{Consumer Surplus}
            \par Relating the \ul{regular demand}, \ul{choice diagram} and \ul{compensated demand}.
        
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Consumer surplus} is the difference between what you are \ul{willing to pay (MRS)} and what you have to pay for \ul{each unit} in your chosen bundle \ul{quantified in dollars}.
            \end{definition}
            
            \paragraph{Calculating Consumer Surplus}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Identify the original bundle chosen and utility level $\overline{u}$.
                \item Calculate $h_1(p_1, \textcolor{red}{p_2=1},\overline{u})$.
                \item $CS = \int_{p^*}^{\infty}{h_1(p_1,p_2=1,\overline{u})}\ dp_1$
            \end{enumerate}
            
            \begin{remark}
                If the preference is \textbf{quasi-linear}, then for \ul{non-numeraire} commodities, consumer surplus calculated from compensated and uncompensated demand curves are the same.
            \end{remark}
        
        \subsection{Expenditure Function}
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Expenditure function} is the value function for consumer expenditure minimization problem.
                \[
                    e(\vec{p}, \overline{u}) = \min_{\vec{x}} \{\vec{x} \cdot \vec{p}\ s.t.\ u(\vec{x}) \geq \overline{u}\} = \vec{p} \cdot \vec{h}^*(\vec{p}, \overline{u})
                \]
            \end{definition}
        
        \subsection{Compensating Variation}
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Compensating Variation(CV)} is the amount of compensation consumer needs to achieve it's \ul{original utility level} with the \ul{new price}.
                \[
                    |CV| = e(
                    \textcolor{red}{
                        \vec{p}_{final}, \overline{u}_{initial}
                        }) - I
                \]
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{remark}
                Consider a change on $p_i$ from $p_i^1$ to $p_i^2$, the prices for other commodities $\overline{p}_{-i}$ are unchanged. By Sheppard's lemma, $\pd{e(\cdot)}{p_i} = h_i$.
                \[
                    |CV| = e(p_i^2, \overline{p}_{-i}, \overline{u}_{initial}) - e(p_i^1, \overline{p}_{-i}, \overline{u}_{initial}) = \int_{p_i^1}^{p_i^2}{h_i(p_i, \overline{u}_{initial})\ dp_i}
                \]
            \end{remark}
        
        \subsection{Equivalent Variation}
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Equivalent Variation (EV)} is the amount of compensation consumer needs at \ul{initial price} to make him as well off as \ul{after} the price change.
                \[
                    |EV| = e(
                    \textcolor{red}{
                        \vec{p}_{initial}, \overline{u}_{final}
                        }) - I 
                \]
            \end{definition}
        
        \begin{remark}
            Consider a change on $p_i$ from $p_i^1$ to $p_i^2$, the prices for other commodities $\overline{p}_{-i}$ are unchanged.
            \[
                |EV| = e(p_i^1, \overline{p}_{-i}, \overline{u}_{final}) - e(p_i^2, \overline{p}_{-i}, \overline{u}_{final}) = \int_{p_i^2}^{p_i^1}{h_i(p_i, \overline{u}_{final})\ dp_i}
            \]
        \end{remark}
        
        \paragraph{Exit Question}
            CV and EV are derived from integral of compensated demand $h_i$ at difference utility levels.
            \textcolor{blue}{For quasi-linear preferences, $|CV| = |EV|$}
            , since there is no income effect, compensated demand curves at any utility level coincides the uncompensated demand curve. Therefore both CV and EV are derived from integral compensated demand and they have the \ul{absolute absolute value} \emph{but opposite sign}.
    
    \section{Lecture 8 Dead Weight Loss and Uncertainty}
        \begin{remark}
            In general, the compensated and uncompensated demand curves intersect at one point (where the compensated demand curve is constructed). As we move away from that point by changing prices, the quantity on CD and Reg.D will differ because the CD captures only SE but regular demand captures both IE and SE.
        \end{remark}

        \subsection{Dead Weight Loss(DWL)}
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Dead weight loss} is the \ul{loss in surplus} that could have been captured by someone in the economy but isn't.
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{remark}
                DWL is due to a \textbf{substitution effect} - changing relative prices causes people to move away from relatively more expensive good, lowering tax revenue.
            \end{remark}
            
            \begin{remark}
                Lump-sum tax causes pure income effect and therefore no dead weight loss. We calculate the DWL from taxation using 
                \[
                    DWL = |T - L|
                \]
                where $T$ is the actual tax revenue.
            \end{remark}

            \subsubsection{Calculating DWL from taxation}
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Put composite good on y-axis of the choice diagram.
                    \item Find \ul{post tax} choice $\vec{x}_t$ and utility level $\overline{u}_t$.
                    \item Calculate $EV = I - e(\vec{p}_{initial}, \overline{u}_t)$. And notice $EV$ is the maximum amount of lump sum tax could be charged leaving consumer at least as well as charging them proportional tax $t$ on commodity.
                    \item Calculate $T = t*p_x*x^t$.
                    \item $DWL = |T - L|$. (\ul{focus on the absolute value})
                \end{enumerate}
            
        \subsection{Duality}
            \begin{remark}
                Notice at the optimal, 
                \[
                    v(\vec{p}, e(\vec{p}, u)) = u
                \]
                and
                \[
                    e(\vec{p}, v(\vec{p}, I)) = I
                \]
                Indirect utility function $v(\vec{p}, I)$ and expenditure function $e(\vec{p}, u)$ are invert of each other.
            \end{remark}

            \subsubsection{Setup}

                        (x_A, x_S) =

                \begin{definition}
                    A general form of \text{insurance} is paying \textbf{premium} $p$ in \ul{both} states and get \textbf{benefit} $b$ only in a certain state.
                \end{definition}
                
                \begin{example}
                    With endowed income $(e_A, e_S)$, an insurance costs premium $p$ in both states and pays benefit $b$ in accident state only transforms the consumption bundle
                    \[
                        \begin{cases}
                            x_A = e_A \\
                            x_S = e_S \\
                        \end{cases} \rightarrow
                        \begin{cases}
                            x_A = e_A - p + b \\
                            x_S = e_S - p
                        \end{cases}
                    \]
                \end{example}
                
                \begin{remark}
                    We usually consider two types of insurance contracts:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item \textbf{Buy or not:} Comparing the \ul{expected utility level} with and without insurance.
                        \item \textbf{How much to buy:} \textcolor{red}{negative amount allowed}.
                    \end{enumerate}
                \end{remark}
                
                \par Consider the insurance contract
                \[
                    b = \gamma p
                \]
                Then the budget constraint between $x_A$ and $x_S$ becomes
                \[
                    x_S = e_S + \frac{\gamma}{1 - \gamma}(e_A - x_A)
                \]
                Therefore we can find the opportunity cost for each unit of $x_A$ is 
                \[
                    \frac{dx_S}{dx_A} = - \frac{\gamma}{1 - \gamma}
                \]
            \paragraph{Exit Question}
            \textcolor{blue}{When insurance gets more expensive ($\gamma \uparrow$), how does the budget constraint change?} The budget constraint \textbf{rotates} around the endowment point. It's getting steeper (with accident consumption on x-axis and safe consumption on y-axis) as more safe state consumption are needed to be given up ($p$) for one more unit of accident state consumption ($b - p = (1 - \gamma)*b$).
    
    \section{Lecture 9 Uncertainty}
        \subsection{Budget Constraint}
            \begin{remark} Given insurance in $p = \gamma b$ form, budget constraint captures the \ul{trade off between safe state disposable income and accident state disposable income}.
            \end{remark}
            \par Given disposable incomes in both states
            \[
                \begin{cases}
                    x_A = e_A + \frac{1 - \gamma}{\gamma}p\\
                    x_S = e_S - p \\
                \end{cases}
            \]
            and combining above equations gives the \textbf{budget constraint},
            \[
                \textcolor{red}{
                    x_A = e_A + (e_S - x_S)(\frac{1 - \gamma}{\gamma})
                    }
            \]
            where the \textbf{opportunity cost} is 
            \[
                \frac{dx_S}{dx_A} = - \frac{\gamma}{1 - \gamma}

                \begin{definition}
                    The market is defined as, with $N$ firms. Each firm selects \textbf{quantity} $x_i$ to produce. Therefore the \textbf{market supply} $X$ is 
                    \[

                    and the market demand is given by invert demand function $p_x(X)$. Thus, \textbf{market clearance price} would be 
                    \[

                \paragraph{Methodology} \emph{Firstly find best responses of firms and then find the mutually best responses.}
                
                \begin{example} (without fixed cost)
                    Consider two identical firms facing market demand $p(X) = 100 - X = 100 - x_1 - x_2$ and cost function $C_i(x_i) = x_i^2$. And best response could be solved in functional form
                    \[
                        Br_i(x_{-i}) = f(x_{-i})\ i \in \{1, 2\}
                    \]
                    Then solve simultaneous equation
                    \[
                        \begin{cases}
                            Br_1(x_2^{NE}) = x_1^{NE} \\
                            Br_2(x_1^{NE}) = x_2^{NE} \\
                        \end{cases}

                \begin{remark}
                    With \ul{fixed costs}, FOC stays the same but need to \ul{assert positive profit}. And maximum profits are decreasing in $x_{-i}$ and the shutdown point will be lower in terms of competitor's production level.

        \subsection{Cartels}
            \subsection{Profit}
                \begin{definition}
                    \textbf{Cartel} is a group of firms that collude to pick quantities and agree to all \ul{lower quantities} to \ul{increase price}.
                \end{definition}
                
                \begin{remark}
                    Total profit for Cartel is maximized at the \ul{monopoly quantity} $x_M$. And assume each firm produces $\frac{x_M}{N}$. \footnote{It is not necessary for each firm to produce at the same level.}
                \end{remark}
                
            \subsection{Sustainability}
                \begin{remark} \textbf{Cheating}
                    The marginal revenue for individual firm is higher than the marginal revenue for Cartel as a group (monopoly) since each individual firm has \ul{less previous units sold}. (Notice: they have to decrease prices for all units sold to sell one additional unit) Therefore, at quantity assigned by Cartel group, $\frac{x_M}{N}$, $MR > MC$ and firm has incentive to increase their production quantity to improve profit. 
                    \[
                        Br_i(x_{-i}^C) > \frac{x_M}{N}
                    \]
                \end{remark}
                
                \begin{remark}
                    Cartel quantity $\frac{x_M}{N}$ is not a Nash equilibrium unless firms have ability to punish each other. (includes cost of cartel dissolving: less profit earned without Cartel)
                \end{remark}
                
                \begin{remark} \textbf{Punishment}
                    To maintain the sustainability of Cartel, the \ul{cost of being punished}$C_{Pi}$ to firm $i$ should be greater or equal to \ul{the net benefit from cheating} for firm $i$.
                    \[
                        \big \{ p_x(x_{-i}^C + Br_i(x_{-i}^C)) - AC \big \} \times Br_i(x_{-i}^C) - (p_x(x_M) - AC) \times \frac{x_M}{N} \leq C_{Pi}

        \subsection{Stackelberg Model of Oligopoly}
            \subsubsection{Market}
                \paragraph{Market demand} The (inverse) market demand for good $x$ is a function of market level of production $X = \sum_{i=1}^N{x_i}$
                \[

                    \end{enumerate}
                    Non-negative quantity constraint is given by solving 
                    \[
                        x_{1}^*\ s.t.\ x_2^*(x_1) = 0
                    \]
                    And non-negative profit constraint is given by solving
                    \[
                        x_{1}^{**}\ s.t.\ \pi_2(x_1, x_2^*(x_1)) = 0 
                    \]
                    and combining both constraint, we have 
                    \[
                        Br_2(x_1) = 
                        \begin{cases}
                            x_2^*(x_1) = argmax_{x_2} \big \{ \pi_2(x_1,x_2) \big \} \tx{ if } x_1 \leq \min\{x_1^*, x_1^{**}\} \\
                            0 \tx{ if } x \geq \min\{x_1^*, x_1^{**}\} \\
                        \end{cases}
                    \]

                \par Given market demand $x_D(p)$ and each firm faces cost function $C_i(p)$. Firms have to serve all consumers came, even if that leads to a loss. Each firm $i$ facing demand, given price of the other firm $p_{-i}$
                \[
                x_i(p_1, p_2) = 
                    \begin{cases}
                        x_D(p_i) \tx{ if } p_i < p_{-i} \\
                        \frac{x_D(p_i)}{2}\ \tx{ if } p_i = p_{-i} \\

    \section{Lecture 22 Externalities}
        \subsection{Externalities}
            \par Generally issues on merging two parties to deal disjoint profit problem (externality).
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Credit constraint.
                    \item Negotiation costs can cause loss.
                \end{enumerate}
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Externality} is the cost or benefit imposed on a \ul{third party} which is external to market activity.
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{definition}
                \textbf{Social costs} is private costs plus \ul{negative} externalities. And \textbf{social benefits} is private benefits plus \ul{positive} externalities.
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{theorem}
                \textbf{Coase Theorem} if transaction costs are negligibly low, it does not matter how property rights are assigned, as long as they are clearly defined, the efficient outcome is attainable. \textcolor{red}{Assumptions of this theorem are too strict, therefore this theorem is extremely limited.}
            \end{theorem}
        
        \subsection{Techniques for Dealing with Externalities}
            \subsubsection{Per-unit Pigovian Tax}
                \par Let $x^s$ denote the socially optimal quantity, that's, 
                \[
                    MSC(x^s) = MSB(x^s)
                \]
                and per-unit pigovian tax to deal with externality can be found at
                \[
                    t = MSC(x^s) - MPC(x^s) = MEC(x^s)
                \]
            
            \subsubsection{Per-unit Pigovian Subsidies}
                \[
                    s = MSB(x^s) - MPB(x^s) = MEB(x^s)
                \]
            
            \subsubsection{Vouchers}
                \par \emph{Limit pollution directly} Create \ul{perfectly inelastic supply} of vouchers for that amount of pollution. Charge per-unit tax $r$ on pollution for $\delta$ units of pollution and close up the gap.
                \[
                    r \times \delta(x^s) = MEC(x^s)
                \]
                \paragraph{Disadvantages} need to be able to measure pollution.
                \paragraph{Advantages} Shifts production towards firms that pollute less and encourages firms to develop cleaner technology.
