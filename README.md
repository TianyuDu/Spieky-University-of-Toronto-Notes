### Summer 2019
* CS229: Machine Learning (Stanford University) [Download](https://github.com/TianyuDu/Spikey_UofT_Notes/tree/master/2019Summer/CS229)
  <details><summary> Course Content</summary>
  <p>
    This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning, parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods); learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs, practical advice); reinforcement learning and adaptive control. The course will also discuss recent applications of machine learning, such as to robotic control, data mining, autonomous navigation, bioinformatics, speech recognition, and text and web data processing.

### Winter 2019

* ECO326H Advanced Microeconomics - Game Theory [Download](https://github.com/TianyuDu/Spikey_UofT_Notes/blob/master/2018Fall_2019Winter/ECO326/eco326.pdf)

  <details><summary>Course Content</summary>
  <p>
  This is a class in game theory. Game theory analyzes the behavior of small groups of agents in strategic situations, ie., situations where the actions of each of the agents may affect payoffs or incentives of the others. The class will be quite rigorous as one of its goals is to give you some idea about what people study in a formal economics graduate program. The main emphasis will be on learning formal concepts and methods how to approach and think about games. As illustrations, we will see a broad range of application from economics, political science, sociology, job search, dating, etc.

* ECO374H Forecasting and Time Series Econometrics [Download](https://github.com/TianyuDu/Spikey_UofT_Notes/blob/master/2018Fall_2019Winter/ECO374/eco374.pdf)

  <details><summary>Course Content</summary>
  <p>
  The primary objective of the course is to provide students with a solid theoretical and practical foundation for forecasting and time series analysis. The course is built around the statistical foundations and economic application of modeling stochastic processes. Key examples will be drawn from business and financial economics. Students will gain practical experience working with economic and financial data, making use of statistical software.

* ECO325H1 (Fall) Advanced Economic Theory - Macro [Download](https://github.com/TianyuDu/Spikey_UofT_Notes/blob/master/2018Fall_2019Winter/ECO325/eco325.pdf)

  <details><summary>Course Content</summary>
  <p>
  This course is designed for majors and specialists in economics who wish to prepare for graduate work in economics and /or expand their understanding of modern macroeconomics theory. During this half course students will develop analytical skills in solving and constructing macroeconomic models. The advanced topics covered will include topics such as: growth theory and the Solow growth model, theories of consumption, investment and savings, general equilibrium models, and business cycles theory.

  <p>
  Econometrics combines elements of economic theory, statistics, probability theory, and mathematics. The
  primary objective of the course is to provide students with a solid theoretical and practical foundation for
  the interpretation of empirical evidence in economics. The course is built around the statistical
  foundations and economic application of the multiple regression model. Students will gain practical
  experience working with economic data using statistical software.
